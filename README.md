# NeuroCont:  a MATLAB® and Simulink® Neuromorphic Toolbox for Control

A MATLAB® and Simulink® Toolbox designed to build and analyse control system built using neuromorphic components and principles.

It provides a library of Simulink® blocks implementing neuromorphic components as well as functions to analyse signals and apply device mismatch to Simulink® models.
