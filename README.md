# NeuroCont:  a MATLAB® and Simulink® Neuromorphic Toolbox for Control

A MATLAB® and Simulink® Toolbox designed to build and analyse control system built using neuromorphic components and principles.

It provides a library of Simulink® blocks implementing neuromorphic components as well as functions to analyse signals and apply device mismatch to Simulink® models.

The details on how to install and use the toolbox can be found on the [documentation website](https://neuromorphic-toolbox-for-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
