Creating and Simulating a Model
===============================

To illustrate the workflow of building and simulating a model in the toolbox the example of building a simplified circuit inspired by :footcite:t:`soto_simplifiedstg_2001`. 


Creating the model
------------------

Building a model is done mostly in the |simulink| window placing
