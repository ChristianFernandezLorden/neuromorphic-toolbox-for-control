    abstract  = {Feedback is a key element of regulation, as it shapes the sensitivity of a process to its environment. Positive feedback upregulates, and negative feedback downregulates. Many regulatory processes involve a mixture of both, whether in nature or in engineering. This article revisits the mixed-feedback paradigm, with the aim of investigating control across scales. We propose that mixed feedback regulates excitability and that excitability plays a central role in multiscale neuronal signaling. We analyze this role in a multiscale network architecture inspired by neurophysiology. The nodal behavior defines a mesoscale that connects actuation at the microscale to regulation at the macroscale. We show that mixed-feedback nodal control provides regulatory principles at the network scale, with a nodal resolution. In this sense, the mixed-feedback paradigm is a control principle across scales.}

    abstract  = {The faithful production of rhythms by many neural circuits depends critically on the strengths of inhibitory synaptic connections. We propose a model in which the strengths of inhibitory synapses in a central pattern-generating circuit are subject to activity-dependent plasticity. The strength of each synapse is modified as a function of the global activity of the postsynaptic neuron and by correlated activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This allows the self-assembly, from random initial synaptic strengths, of two cells into reciprocal oscillation and three cells into a rhythmic triphasic motor pattern. This self-assembly illustrates that complex oscillatory circuits that depend on multiple inhibitory synaptic connections can be tuned via simple activity-dependent rules.},
